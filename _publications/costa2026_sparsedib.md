abstract: "Cluster analysis relates to the task of assigning objects into groups which ideally present some desirable characteristics. When a cluster structure is confined to a subset of the feature space, traditional clustering techniques face unprecedented challenges. We present an information-theoretic framework that overcomes the problems associated with sparse data, allowing for joint feature weighting and clustering. Our proposal constitutes a competitive alternative to existing clustering algorithms for sparse data, as demonstrated through simulations on synthetic data. The effectiveness of our method is established by an application on a real-world genomics data set."  # Abstract
