As of October 2025, I am a Research Associate with teaching duties in Statistics at Imperial College London, working with Professor [Axel Gandy](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/index.html).

Prior to this position, I was a PhD student at Imperial College London in the Statistics and Machine Learning Centre for Doctoral Training ([StatML CDT](https://statml.io/), 2021 Cohort), under the academic supervision of Dr [Ioanna Papatsouma](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/i.papatsouma) and Professor [Alastair Young](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/alastair.young).

I was also a visiting student at the University of Bologna, working under the supervision of Professor [Christian Martin Hennig](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/christian.hennig/en) between January and March 2024.

I am interested in a broad range of topics in methodological and multivariate statistics, as well as in machine learning. My research is currently centred on the confluence of unsupervised learning methodologies for mixed-type data with concepts of robustness.
