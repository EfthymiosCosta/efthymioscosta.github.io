I have been an <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship">Associate Fellow of Advance HE (AFHEA)</a> since February 2024. I am also an ambassador of the MSc Statistics programme at Imperial College London, in recognition of outstanding contributions to the running and delivery of the programme.
<br><br>
I was also a highly commended nominee for the Faculty of Natural Sciences (FoNS) Prize for Excellence in teaching and learning at the FoNS Annual Prizes 2025.
<br><br>
Below is a list of undergraduate & postgraduate courses in which I have been actively involved as a (Senior) Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) or as a marker at Imperial College London.
